# Domain-Guided-Weather-BiLSTM-Risk-Prediction
This project classifies real-time weather-based risk levels (Low, Medium, High) using a Bidirectional LSTM on multivariate time-series weather data. Includes train/validation/test splits, class balancing, one-hot encoding, model training with early stopping &amp; LR scheduling, evaluation, and visualization of feature distributions and correlations.
